# Ping-Program-Application-using-Python


in this task i developed a ping program application using python This task involved creating a custom Ping application using Python, 
focusing on networking concepts such as sockets, ICMP messages, and packet structuring. The implementation required a deep understanding of raw socket programming and the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). 
Instead of using built-in system commands, we manually created and sent ICMP packets, extracted responses, and calculated round-trip times.
